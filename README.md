### Hi, I'm Marie GARDE a web Developer from France !
About Me

    Passionate about the development of web projects, I naturally turned to the career of a web developer.

    Currently in training as a WEB developer at the Wild Code School in Lille, I am looking for a company that could welcome me as part of an agreed internship of at least 4 months from February to March.

    The training gravitated mainly on the JavaScript stack, notably ReactJS for the front-end side and NodeJS with Express for the backend with the use of MySQL. Proficiency in collaboration software such as Git, GitHub, Slack.

    Today I want to deepen my skills and develop new ones, the position of web developer in HTML5, CSS3, ReactJS and NodeJS technologies perfectly matches my objectives and that is why I allow myself to send you my application.

    Autonomous, rigorous and creative, I am very invested in my work and particularly appreciate teamwork.

Technologies

    Languages : HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript
    Backend : Node.js
    Frontend : React.js, Angular
    CSS FrameWork : Bootstrap
    Database : MySQL
