### Hi, I'm Marie GARDE a web Developer from France !

About Me

    Graduated at the end of 2017 as agronomist, I worked 2 years as a trade. Currently I'm starting my retraining in an environment that is important to me : digital, as a web developer. 
    I took a course at WildcodeSchool during 5 months on ReactJs and NodeJs technologies, before joining IBM Lille as an inter on Angular and NodeJs technologies.

    The training gravitated mainly on the JavaScript stack, notably ReactJS for the front-end side and NodeJS with Express for the backend with the use of MySQL, and I'm currently training on Angular.
